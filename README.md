# How to play

Two Xbox One controllers are recommended to play. Use the left stick to move, and the X Button to dash and hit your opponent to make it lose parts. Collect the most parts and when you're full as indicated in the UI, go on the repairing station and repair yourself with the Y Button. Beware, each time the number of parts increases! Whoever clears 3 stages wins.

# Power Ups
## Sprint
Boost your speed significantly. Dashing cancels it.

## Invincibility Shield
Protects you from the next it. Dashing cancels it.

## Laser Gun
Can hit the opponent from distance, destroys two pieces. Activate with the X Button.

## Rocket Launcher
Shoots a Rocket which makes the target lose one stage and all its collected parts.

**KNOWN MAJOR ISSUE**: The Rocket also affects the shooter so... Don't.
